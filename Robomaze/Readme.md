This game is a simple maze game called "RoboMaze". The player controls a robot character who must navigate through a maze to reach the end. The maze is represented as a two-dimensional array of characters, and the robot's position and direction are tracked internally by global variables in the Python code.
The player can use keyboard input to control the robot's movements: pressing "f" moves the robot forward, "l" turns it left, and "r" turns it right. If the robot reaches the bottom-right corner of the maze, the game is won! The game features an ASCII art representation of the game board with the robot's position indicated on it.
