# Mind Reader

**Mind Reader** is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python. The game has two modes: singleplayer and multiplayer.

In singleplayer mode, the player has to guess a number between 1 and 10 within a time limit of 10 seconds. The game provides hints based on the player's guess, and the score is reduced with each incorrect guess.

In multiplayer mode, two players take turns to guess the number, and the first player who guesses correctly wins the game. The game also records the score for each player.
